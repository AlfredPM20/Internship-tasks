# Handwritten Digit Recognition

My first project at GrowIntern's Machine Learning internship.

The task:

Build a project, Which detects & recognize handwritten digits. This uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

This project provides a complete solution for recognizing handwritten digits using a neural network. It consists of two main components:

1. Model Training: A script (train_model.py) that trains a neural network on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. The trained model is saved as handwritten_digit_model.h5.

2. Interactive Application: A Pygame-based application (pygame_app.py) that allows users to draw digits on the screen and predicts the digit using the trained model. The application provides real-time predictions and can clear the drawing area with a key press.
